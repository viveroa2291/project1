    <h1>Back to C</h1>
<div id="date">December 17, 2019</div>
<p>It is the first day of winter break. My mother encouraged me to keep my brain from wasting away and handed me this book on the C programming language that she used in college:</p>

<p>I read the book cover to cover. All one needed back in the day was to install a compiler. Mom had it easy. She'd freak out if I showed her <code>node_modules</code>. Perhaps someday computing will be simple again. But I think there's a law somewhere that says technological complexity will only increase.</p>

<p>Once I finished, I wrote my first C program. Here it is:</p>
<div class = "code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; 

    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
</div>
<p>I will never write another. Here's to a lifetime of learning!</p>
