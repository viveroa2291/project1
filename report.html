        <h2>Clients Critique</h2>
        <br> <p>1. Doesn't like how the Home screen only has one picture and not much content on it. Suggest for there to be more.</p>
        <br> <p>2. It's not suitable for mobile as well and is messed up opening up the 'about' page.</p>
        <br> <p>3. The text is not aligned within the boxes in 'useful exercises'. </p>
        <br> <p>4. Everything else she enjoys.</p>
